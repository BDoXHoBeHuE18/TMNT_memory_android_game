# Memory Android Game
# Description
This is my memory android game. In this game you should find pairs of the same cards. <br>
The theme is the cards of the 2003's Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles cartoon. <br>
Leonardo, Mickelangelo, Raphael and Donatello have their own cards and you should find them all. 
#
# Game functionality
In this game you can chose a few modes through the second (from up to down) main menu's button.<br>
Each mode represents a specific size of the playing field:
- 2x2
- 3x3
- 4x4
- 5x5
<br>

You have to be very careful!

<br>

Since there are only 4 cards in the game (each turtle has its own card) sometimes you will have to find not just a pair of identical cards but also three/four/five identical cards.
While you attempting to complete any mode game is counting the time you took to complete.<br>
And if your attempt was successful you will see the message with your completing time on the screen (if your attempt was a record time you will be notified too).
By the way you can see your best attempts of each mode through the main menu's corresponding button (in Russian: "Таблица рекордов").

The main menu's and the playing activities have their own soundtracks.
